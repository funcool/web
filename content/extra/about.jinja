      <h3>Small description:</h3>
      <p>
        Software Engineer, specialized on full-stack web development. Highly interested
        in functional programming paradigms and with valuable experience with Clojure(Script), JavaScript,
        Python, Java and modern C++.</p>

      <h3>Skills & Expertise (large description): </h3>

      <p>Currently I'm actively programing in three languages: Clojure(Script), JavaScript and Python.
        And in my free time I learn about haskell and rust.</p>

      <p>I have more than 5 years of experience with Python and Django and its ecosystem. I have
        developed (and currently maintaining) a litle bunch of python libraries like
        <a href="https://github.com/niwinz/django-redis">django-redis</a> and <a href="https://github.com/niwinz/django-jinja">django-jinja</a>. And I have some contributions
        to the core of django, available in version 1.5 and 1.6.</p>

      <p>Also, I have almost 4 years of experience as Javascript developer and the last year is
        mostly the main language that I'm using at my work. I have worked with AngularJs, BackboneJs,
        ReactJs among other frameworks and libraries. <br />
        <a href="https://github.com/taigaio">taiga.io</a> is a great example of projects that I have
        developed.</p>

      <p>The last two years I spend almost all my free time researching about functional paradigms and
        learning and contributing to the opensource using <strong>Clojure</strong> and <strong>ClojureScript</strong>.
        A this moment I don't have professional experinence using them. You can found almost all software that
        I have developed here: <a href="https://github.com/funcool">https://github.com/funcool</a></p>

      <p>And finally, out of programming but not less important, I have knowledge of postgresql
        (as developer and sysop), nginx and RabbitMQ.</p>

      <h3>Other minor details:</h3>

      <p>Git is my first election for code version control, but I have worked with mercurial and subversion.</p>
      <p>I use emacs as ide or text editor and Archlinux with DWM as window manager.</p>
